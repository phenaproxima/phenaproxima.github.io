I quit Twitter recently, for a number of reasons. The one thing that keeps me coming back is [Swear Trek](https://twitter.com/swear_trek). As a fan of both Star Trek and extensive cursing, I feel confident in saying that it is the best feed on Twitter.

As a little homage, and while staying up too late last night, I have decided to invent swear statuses for Drupal issues. Perhaps I’ll write a browser extension for this…

**Active**: This is fucked up

**Needs work**: This is still fucked up

**Needs review**: Look at this shit

**Reviewed & tested by the community**: Good shit

**Fixed**: Fuckin’ A!

**Patch (to be ported)**: Time to rewrite this shit

**Postponed**: I’ll do this shit later

**Postponed (maintainer needs more info)**: What the fuck’s going on here

**Closed (duplicate)**: Not this shit again

**Closed (won’t fix)**: Closed (fuck this bullshit)

**Closed (works as designed)**: Fuck it, works on my machine

**Closed (cannot reproduce)**: Closed (bullshit)

**Closed (outdated)**: Too fucking old
