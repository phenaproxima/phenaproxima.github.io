excerpt: Ebert's Law of Programming!
---
Today I want to share this tiny excerpt from the late, great Roger Ebert’s panning of the movie *Mercury Rising* (unseen by me), because it is perfect programming wisdom:

> Here are the two most obvious problems that sentient audiences will have with the plot. (1) Modern encryption cannot be intuitively deciphered, by rainmen or anyone else, without a key. And, (2) if a nine-year-old kid can break your code, don’t kill the kid, kill the programmers.

Words to live by.
